            <strong>Broken Chip</strong> is the sonic alias of Australian musician and photographer Martyn Palmer, known for crafting deeply immersive
            ambient soundscapes that blend warm, organic textures with delicate electronic flourishes. Drawing
            inspiration from nature, memory, and the quiet beauty of everyday moments, Broken Chip's music often sits at
            the intersection of lowercase, drone, and ambient experimentalism.
            <br><br>
            With a background in field recording and sound design, Palmer uses processed environmental sounds, granular
            synthesis, and subtle melodic fragments to create introspective, meditative compositions. His work has been
            released on labels such as <a href="https://homenormal.bandcamp.com/"> Home Normal</a>, <a
                href="https://flamingpines.bandcamp.com/">Flaming Pines</a> and <a
                href="https://feralmedia.com.au/">Feral Media</a>, and he has performed alongside a diverse range of
            artists in the ambient and experimental music scene.
            <br><br>
            In addition to Broken Chip, Palmer also explores more rhythmic and beat-driven electronic music under the
            moniker <a href="https://soundcloud.com/option-command">Option Command</a>, showcasing his versatility
            across different sonic landscapes.
            <br><br>
            Whether drifting through shimmering drones or crafting intricate micro-sounds, Broken Chips music invites
            listeners into a world of stillness, reflection, and quiet wonder.
